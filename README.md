# Tweetpatcher

This web app gives first responders the opportunity to see what is happening at their dispatched location by allowing them to say or enter the street names to view Twitter posts around the area (filterable by keywords such as "fire", "shooting", "gun", etc.) as well as a map of the area.

This is a hackathon project for the [FirstNet Public Safety Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/firstnet-public-safety-hackathon-san-francisco-tickets-42037952648).

# Development

Use `npm install` first and then `npm start` to start the frontend server.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Backend Server

To get the latest steam of Twitter posts, use the python script located in `/twitterWebApp`.

The backend endpoints for using Watson Speech to Text are in this repo: [FirstNet-Hackathon-18](https://github.com/jsubroto/FirstNet-Hackathon-18)
